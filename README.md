# saveco2
Android app to provide incentives to save CO2.

The user gets three suggestions every day to save CO2 and fullfill a target value.
The task are seperatly stored in an online database and accessed via API, so that changes on tasks can be submitted without an update of the app.


Only code files because of available space limitations.
Error handling and clean documentation does not really exist as it was a hobby project.
